## Live Example

See a Live Working Demo [here](https://ts-calculator-yad.netlify.app/).

## Run Locally

You can run this site locally through cloning the git repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YetAnotherDeveloperYT/ts-calculator.git
```

I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool to get HMR & Typescript support in development. Vite is included as devDependency. So install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install  # if you use npm
pnpm install # if you use pnpm (recommended)
yarn install # if you use yarn (recommended over npm)
```

### Running in development mode

If you want to work on this app run it in development mode to get Hot-module-replacement support.

```bash
npm run dev
pnpm dev
yarn dev
```

### Building the app

Build the app into static files through build command.

```bash
npm run build
pnpm build
yarn build
```

then you can see generated files in `dist` directory. Serve the files through `vite` preview feature.

```bash
npm run preview
pnpm preview
yarn preview
```

_Alternatively_, You can build and serve through a single command.

```bash
npm run serve
pnpm serve
yarn serve
```
